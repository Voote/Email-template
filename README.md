## Reflection

I was ask to help UKPlanetTools, to create responsive Email Template.

This project was quite tricky, because email could look diffrent in diffrent email client. I had to focus on using a table instead of div or grid and it was necessary to avoid all new technologies like CSS3 or HTML5.

To create this template I used mostly HTML with in-line styles. There is some media query in style tag as well, however, a few older email clients may not be compatible with it.

I found a couple of usefool tools witch helped me to create this code:
https://app.postdrop.io/ for dynamic preview,
https://www.htmlemailcheck.com/ to found all dangerous code,
https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/ to convert styles into inline styles.

Feel free to reuse my code and thank you for visiting.
